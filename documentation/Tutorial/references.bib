@article{Aurentz:2017,
	abstract = { Every student of numerical linear algebra is familiar with block matrices and vectors. The same ideas can be applied to the continuous analogues of operators, functions, and functionals. It is shown here how the explicit consideration of block structures at the continuous level can be a useful tool. In particular, block operator diagrams lead to templates for spectral discretization of differential and integral equation boundary-value problems in one space dimension by the rectangular differentiation, identity, and integration matrices introduced recently by Driscoll and Hale. The templates are so simple that we are able to present them as executable MATLAB codes just a few lines long, developing ideas through a sequence of 12 increasingly advanced examples. The notion of the rectangular shape of a linear operator is made mathematically precise by the theory of Fredholm operators and their indices, and the block operator formulations apply to nonlinear problems too. We propose the convention of representing nonlinear blocks as shaded. At each step of a Newton iteration for a nonlinear problem, the structure is linearized and the blocks become unshaded, representing Fr{\'e}chet derivative operators, square or rectangular. },

@article{Farrell:2015,
	abstract = { Nonlinear systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) may permit several distinct solutions. The typical current approach to finding distinct solutions is to start Newton's method with many different initial guesses, hoping to find starting points that lie in different basins of attraction. In this paper, we present an infinite-dimensional deflation algorithm for systematically modifying the residual of a nonlinear PDE problem to eliminate known solutions from consideration. This enables the Newton--Kantorovitch iteration to converge to several different solutions, even starting from the same initial guess. The deflated Jacobian is dense, but an efficient preconditioning strategy is devised, and the number of Krylov iterations is observed not to grow as solutions are deflated. The power of the approach is demonstrated on several problems from special functions, phase separation, differential geometry, and fluid mechanics that permit distinct solutions. },

	abstract = {We construct and quantify asymptotically in the limit of large mass a variety of edge-localized stationary states of the focusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation on a quantum graph. The method is applicable to general bounded and unbounded graphs. The solutions are constructed by matching a localized large amplitude elliptic function on a single edge with an exponentially smaller remainder on the rest of the graph. This is done by studying the intersections of Dirichlet-to-Neumann manifolds (nonlinear analogues of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps) corresponding to the two parts of the graph. For the quantum graph with a given set of pendant, looping, and internal edges, we find the edge on which the state of smallest energy at fixed mass is localized. Numerical studies of several examples are used to illustrate the analytical results.},
